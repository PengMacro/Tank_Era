Two-player Tank-Era Game in C


Using the development platform and TI Launchpad, I designed and implemented a two-player Tank-Era game in C. It had more than 1000 lines 
of code. In this game, monsters will appear and move randomly in a maze. To win the game, the player can use the PS2 joystick or LCD 
touch-screen to command the tank to move and shoot bullets to kill a monster or place a bomb which will kill all monsters nearby. 
If the tank is hit by a monster, the player will lose a heart. I also implemented a Piezo buzzer to create unique sound in 
different game mode.
